## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Tellimer Rock, Paper, Scissors Game technical test. This challenge will help you showcase your skills by building a realistic project that can be a valuable addition to your portfolio.

**To complete this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Svelte, SQL, and Node.js.**

## The Challenge

Your task is to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the provided design files. You will receive a starter repository with a SvelteKit app, a Storybook component library, and necessary data packages. Additionally, you will get environment variables to connect to a database, along with the Figma design and challenge files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size.
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
- **Bonus**: Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser.
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer.

### Game Rules

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses 1 point.

#### Original Version

- Paper beats Rock.
- Rock beats Scissors.
- Scissors beats Paper.

#### Bonus Version

- Scissors beats Paper.
- Paper beats Rock.
- Rock beats Lizard.
- Lizard beats Spock.
- Spock beats Scissors.
- Scissors beats Lizard.
- Paper beats Spock.
- Rock beats Scissors.
- Lizard beats Paper.
- Spock beats Rock.

### Expected Behavior

- **Main Game**: Display the game with options to play Rock, Paper, Scissors or the bonus version with Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the player's score and ensure it persists even after refreshing the browser.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the game looks great on devices of all sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Make sure all interactive elements are accessible and navigable via the keyboard.

### Nice to Have

- Accessibility: Ensure correct navigation through the page and components using the tab key.
- API integration testing using Jest or Vitest.
- CI/CD deployments to Vercel and backend deployment.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning or forking the provided starter repository.
2. **Environment Setup**: Use the provided environment variables to connect to the database.
3. **Design Files**: We will send you the Figma design and challenge files via email.
4. **Component Library**: Utilize the Storybook component library to build your UI components and integrate them into the game.

## Running the Project Locally

- **Environment Requirements**: Node 20.x, Yarn 4.x, Git, Figma.

### Commands to Run the Project

- `yarn install` at the root
- `yarn frontend:start` - starts the frontend project
- `yarn frontend:build` - builds the frontend project
- `yarn frontend:preview` - previews the frontend project
- `yarn storybook:build` - builds the Storybook project
- `yarn storybook:start` - starts the Storybook project
- `yarn components:build` - builds the Storybook project (same as storybook:build)
- `yarn components:start` - starts the Storybook project (same as storybook:start)
- `yarn data:generate` - generates Prisma client
- `yarn data:seed` - seeds the database with some starting data
- `yarn data:migrate` - runs Prisma migrations

## Building Your Project

1. **Build Components**: Create the components as per the pixel-perfect design using Figma, Svelte, and TypeScript.
2. **Implement Functionality**: Ensure the game functions as described in the challenge requirements. Use Node.js and TypeScript for server-side with a backend stack of your choosing.
3. **Commit and Submit**: Commit your code to the forked public repository and inform us when you are done.
4. **Bonus**: Deploy both backend and frontend (not a requirement).

## Submitting Your Solution

1. **Deployment**: If you deploy your application then provide a link to the live application.
2. **Repository**: Commit your code to your public GitHub repository, again provide a link to the repository.
3. **Notification**: Let us know when your project is complete and share the repository link..
